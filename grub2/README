This is GRUB 2, the second version of the GRand Unified Bootloader.
GRUB 2 is rewritten from scratch to make GNU GRUB cleaner, safer, more
robust, more powerful, and more portable.

Because GRUB 2 was formerly developed under the project PUPA, there
remain still many places where PUPA is used instead of GRUB 2. So
suppose that PUPA is a synonym of GRUB 2 for now.

See the file NEWS for a description of recent changes to GRUB 2.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install the
GRUB 2 data and program files.

Please visit the official web page of GRUB 2, for more information.
The URL is <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html>.



Because GRUB 2 is still in developmental stage, GRUB 2 is not for general
use (yet). For now, you can install GRUB 2 into a floppy by these
instructions:

$ configure && make
$ ./pupa-mkimage -v -d . -o core.img _chain ext2
$ dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1
$ dd if=core.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1

It would be easier to use Bochs <http://bochs.sf.net/> than a real
machine.
