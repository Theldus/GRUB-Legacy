2003-01-03  Yoshinori K. Okuji  <okuji@enbug.org>

	* util/i386/pc/pupa-setup.c (setup): Define the internal

	3.0.x cannot compile internal functions in deeper scopes
	correctly.

	REAL_DEV for the working space. Copy it to DEV before returning.
	(open_device) [__linux__]: Call ioctl with BLKFLSBUF to make the
	buffer cache consistent.

	* fs/fat.c (pupa_fat_read_data): Shift 4 instead of 12 when the
	FAT size is 12. The previous value was merely wrong.

	* kern/main.c (pupa_main): Don't split the starting message from
	newlines.

	* kern/term.c (pupa_putchar): Put CR after LF instead of before
	LF, because BIOS goes crazy about character attributes in this
	case.

	directory util/i386/pc.

	bunch of pushl's from pusha, because this destroys the return
	value.

2002-12-28  Yoshinori K. Okuji  <okuji@enbug.org>

	Use -mrtd and -mregparm=3 to reduce the generated code sizes.
	This means that any missing prototypes could be fatal. Also, you
	must take care when writing assembly code. See the comments at
	the beginning of startup.S, for more details.
	
	* kern/i386/pc/startup.S (pupa_halt): Modified for the new

	(pupa_getrtsecs): Use pushl instead of push.

	* kern/i386/pc/init.c (pupa_machine_init): Use the scratch
	memory instead of the stack for a mmap entry, because some
	BIOSes may ignore the maximum size and overflow.

	* conf/i386-pc.rmk (COMMON_CFLAGS): Added -mrtd and -mregparm=3.

	* genmk.rb (PModule#rule): Compile automatically generated
	sources with module-specific CFLAGS as well as other sources.

2002-12-27  Yoshinori K. Okuji  <okuji@enbug.org>

	* configure.ac: Check ld.
	Replace CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS with BUILD_CFLAGS and BUILD_CPPFLAGS
	respectively, before checking endianness and sizes.

	* Makefile.in (LD): New variable.
	
2002-12-27  Yoshinori K. Okuji  <okuji@enbug.org>
