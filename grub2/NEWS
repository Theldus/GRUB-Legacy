New in 0.7:

* Problems in cross-compiling PUPA are fixed.

* Use -mrtd and -mregparm=3 to reduce the generated code sizes.	This
  means that any missing prototypes could be fatal. Also, you must take
  care when writing assembly code. See the comments at the beginning of
  startup.S, for more details.

* New utility, ``pupa-setup''. This sets up PUPA to make it bootable
  from a real disk.

* New commands, "prefix", "insmod", "rmmod" and "lsmod" are added into
  the rescue mode to manipulate PUPA modules.


New in 0.6 - 2002-12-27, Yoshinori K. Okuji:

* The chainloader and the FAT filesystem are modularized.

* The structure of the source tree is a bit changed.

* Support for building loadable modules is added.

* Some generic parts of pupa-mkimage are segregated.

* Some documentation files are added, according to the GNU Coding
  Standards.
