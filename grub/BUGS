Known problems/bugs:

  - GRUB cannot boot FreeBSD 3.4 and 4.0 directly. So you must
    chain-load them instead.

  - GRUB hangs up when accessing a disk via Adaptec AIC-7880
    SCSI-controller in LBA mode. It is unknown if this is due to GRUB or
    the SCSI BIOS. For now, you need to disable the BIOS support for
    INT 13 Extension (that is, you can't use the LBA mode).

  - FreeBSD boot command-line options are slightly problematic, and
    OpenBSD options are probably quite wrong.  This is because they
    use options that are bits in a data word passed at boot time, and
    the developers change the encoding sometimes.  Will re-sync in a later
    release.

  - Password feature in the config file is a bit primitive, and needs
    fleshing out/design work to make more intuitive.

  - If an "uppermem" command was used to tell GRUB it had a different
    amount of upper memory available, then the user escapes to the menu
    interface, the upper memory displayed there still says the amount
    set by the user instead of being reset to the default by the escape.
    It actually resets when the next command-line is entered or config
    file entry is executed.

  - There is at least one problem when using an "install_partition" that is
    a BSD sub-partition where the PC partition isn't explicit (i.e.
    the default 0xFF00FF is a problem)...  this is when using "makeactive"
    without explicitly setting the root partition.  If this is done, a
    "no such partition" error will be generated.

  - Cannot boot FreeBSD "kzip"ed image.  Use a normal kernel (using GRUB's
    automatic "gzip" decompression works fine).

  - Hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete when in GRUB locks some machines.  Use Reset
    for now.  (This apparently hasn't been observed for a while)
