Description: GRand Unified Bootloader
 GRUB is a GPLed bootloader intended to unify bootloading across x86
 operating systems.  In addition to loading Linux and FreeBSD, it
 implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
 of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the GNU
 Hurd).
