  * Assembly source cleanups.

grub (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put everything in /lib/grub (not /boot/grub) and don't install during
    postinst so that we can't accidentally wreck a working system.  This
    means the package needn't be experimental anymore.
  * Get rid of grubinst because it doesn't work with 0.5, and I'd rather
    improve GRUB's builtin installation process.
  * Use `e' rather than enter to edit.
  * Minor bug fixes.
