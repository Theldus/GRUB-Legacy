Get /sbin/grub to work.

Change partition syntax to correspond with BSD ``slice'' syntax
(`(hd0,1a)' -> `/dev/hd0s2a').

Add a partition naming syntax that means ``the first partition of this
type''.  We need this for clean Hurd install floppies.

Find out the size restrictions for FAT and ext2fs stage1.5 boot
blocks.  Enforce all arbitrary limits using the Makefiles.

Look at network booting.

Add stripped-down Guile support, and rewrite current behaviour in
Scheme.  Make sure not to break backward compatibilty, or else we'll
be roasted by anti-Guile people.

Add internationalization support, emulating gettext as much as is
feasible.

Maybe add BIOS password support.  In any event, improve the existing
password support.

	Add support/delays so that a floppy can be installed from
	another floppy.

	Add bootable CDROM support (this probably means I have to support
	ISO-9660 plus maybe even the Rock Ridge extensions...  ugh).
	Add/Finish LBA and/or Int13 extensions support.

	Fix keyboard/gateA20 bug (????  at least look at the code).
	The keyboard status bits may be checked wrong.

	Add indirect block support to the BSD FFS filesystem code, so files
	larger than 16MB can be read.
	???  Make symbolic links work for BSD FFS.

	???  Add command for modifying partition types.

	Fix-up FreeBSD, NetBSD (and OpenBSD ?) command-line boot parameters
