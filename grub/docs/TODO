	Check for other patches sent in e-mail!!!  There are several...

	Add support/delays so that a floppy can be installed from
	another floppy.

	Add bootable CDROM support (this probably means I have to support
	ISO-9660 plus maybe even the Rock Ridge extensions...  ugh).
	Add/Finish LBA and/or Int13 extensions support.

	Fix keyboard/gateA20 bug (????  at least look at the code).
	The keyboard status bits may be checked wrong.

	Add indirect block support to the BSD FFS filesystem code, so files
	larger than 16MB can be read.
	???  Make symbolic links work for BSD FFS and Linux ext2fs filesystems.

	???  Add command for modifying partition types.

	Fix-up FreeBSD, NetBSD (and OpenBSD ?) command-line boot parameters
