Get /sbin/grub to work.

Automatically generate source dependencies.  This might involve some
patches to Automake (if so, we should also fix the fact that we
currently need dummy.c in _SOURCES in order to get the C compiler flag
variables).

Change partition syntax to correspond with BSD ``slice'' syntax
(`(hd0,1a)' -> `/dev/hd0s2a').

Add a partition naming syntax that means ``the first partition of this
type''.  We need this for clean Hurd install floppies.

Find out the size restrictions for FAT and ext2fs stage1.5 boot
blocks.  Enforce all arbitrary limits using the Makefiles.

Add/Finish LBA and/or Int13 extensions support.

Add a real scripting language, possibly retain backward compatibility
so that old config files can be used.

Look at the network booting patches from L4.

Add internationalization support, emulating gettext as much as is
feasible.

Add support/delays so that a floppy can be installed from another
floppy.

Add bootable CDROM support (this probably means I have to support
ISO-9660 plus maybe even the Rock Ridge extensions...  ugh).

Make symbolic links work for BSD FFS.

Fix keyboard/gateA20 bug (????  at least look at the code).  The
keyboard status bits may be checked wrong.

Add indirect block support to the BSD FFS filesystem code, so files
larger than 16MB can be read.

???  Add command for modifying partition types.

Fix-up FreeBSD, NetBSD (and OpenBSD ?) command-line boot parameters
