Before working on anything in this file, it's very important that you
make contact with the core GRUB developers. Things herein might be
slightly out of date or otherwise not easy to understand at first
glance. So write to <bug-grub@gnu.org> first.

Priorities:
  Reported bugs generally have top priority.
  Non-reported and non-encountered bugs (things we know don't work,
    but don't really impede things) have lower priority.
  Things in this file are ranked with one to three !; the more, the
  higher priority.


* Add configuration inclusion support by adding a command "include". !

* Make symbolic links work for BSD FFS. !!

* Add indirect block support to the BSD FFS filesystem code, so files
  larger than 16MB can be read. !

* Fix-up FreeBSD, NetBSD (and OpenBSD ?) command-line boot
  parameters. !!!

* Support embedding a Stage 1.5 in the "bootloader" area of a FFS
  partition. !!!

* Support embedding a Stage 1.5 in the EXT2_BOOT_LOADER_INO of an ext2fs
  partition.  Maybe we can just make a hard link to an existing file? !

* Complete the netboot support. !

* Add automatic configuration support.

* Add bunzip2 support.

* Define the module system. !

* Add ISA PnP support.

* Fix the completion so that it works for BSD partitions as well. !!

* Add BSD syntax support, using results of ioprobe to map drives.
  (0x1f0-0x1f77 = primary IDE, 0x170-0x176 = secondary,
   0x1e8-0x1ef = tertiary, 0x168-0x16f = quaternary).

* Add more filesystems support (XFS, NTFS, etc.)

* Add remote console support (serial, parallel and net).

* Add RAID support.

? Add a partition naming syntax that means ``the first partition of
  this type''.  We need this for clean Hurd install floppies.

* Add a real scripting language, possibly retaining backward
  compatibility so that old config files can be used.

* Add internationalization support, emulating gettext as much as is
  feasible.

* Fix keyboard/gateA20 bug (????  at least look at the code). The
  keyboard status bits may be checked wrong.

? Add command for modifying partition types.
