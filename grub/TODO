Change partition syntax to correspond with BSD ``slice'' syntax
(`(hd0,1a)' -> `/dev/hd0s2a').

Add a partition naming syntax that means ``the first partition of this
type''.  We need this for clean Hurd install floppies.

Add a real scripting language, possibly retaining backward
compatibility so that old config files can be used.

Look at the network booting patches from L4.

Add internationalization support, emulating gettext as much as is
feasible.

Add bootable CDROM support (this probably means we have to support
ISO-9660 plus maybe even the Rock Ridge extensions...  ugh).

Make symbolic links work for BSD FFS.

Fix keyboard/gateA20 bug (????  at least look at the code).  The
keyboard status bits may be checked wrong.

Add indirect block support to the BSD FFS filesystem code, so files
larger than 16MB can be read.

???  Add command for modifying partition types.

Fix-up FreeBSD, NetBSD (and OpenBSD ?) command-line boot parameters

Add keyboard layout configuration support.

Clean up and enhance the manuals, especially concept indexes.

Add more filesystems support (XFS, NTFS, etc.)

Add remote console support (serial, parallel and net).
