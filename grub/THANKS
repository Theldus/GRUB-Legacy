GRUB would not be what it is today without the invaluable help of
everybody who was kind enough to spend time testing it and reporting
bugs.

The following people made especially gracious contributions of their
time and energy in helping to track down bugs, add new features, and
generally assist in the GRUB maintainership process:

Bryan Ford <baford@cs.utah.edu>
Eric Hanchrow <erich@microsoft.com>
Heiko Schroeder <heiko@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>
Miles Bader <miles@gnu.org>
OKUJI Yoshinori <okuji@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp>
VaX#n8 <vax@linkdead.paranoia.com>
