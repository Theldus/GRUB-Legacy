	* shared_src/shared.h (get_cmdline): Fix declaration.
	(grub_strcmp): Declare.

	(biosdisk): Call read instead of fread.

	Add options so that the user can specify the config file.

	-Wmissing-prototypes -Wunused.

	* shared_src/shared.h: Delete stupid declarations, and totally
	rearrange for clarity.

	* stage1/stage1.S: Modify to use GAS's new .code16 semantics.
	shared_src/asm.S: Likewise.

	* configure: Test to see if the `addr32' instruction is supported.
	Ian Lance Taylor says that GAS's interpretation of `.code16' has
	changed.  Older versions always generated 32-bit code, but
	implicitly inserted addr32 and data32 when .code16 was given.
	Newer versions generate 16-bit code, and require manual addr32 and
	data32 overrides.

	* shared_src/shared.h: Add some assertions to check that buffer
	addresses are properly defined.

	* shared_src/stage2.c (run_menu): Pause if we failed to boot both
	the default and fallback entries.

	* configure: Check to make sure that GAS actually honors .code16
	directives.

	* shared_src/asm.S: Fix typo that called interrupt 0xd (decimal
	13) instead of 0x13.

1999-01-31  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* e2fs_stage1_5/Makefile: Avoid gratuitous dependencies on
	Makefile.
	* fat_stage1_5/Makefile: Likewise.
	* ffs_stage1_5/Makefile: Likewise.

	* Makefile.end (PROGS): Add e2fs_stage1_5, fat_stage1_5, and
	grubinst.
	(distclean): New GNU standard rule.

	* configure: Accept `--host' as a synonym for `--target', and
	accept a non-optional argument as the target name.  Join the
	prefix to the tool name with a hyphen.

	* shared_src/disk_io.c (print_fsys_type): Always print the
	partition type.

	* shared_src/stage2.c (run_menu): Check to make sure that the
	fallback entry is nonnegative.
	(run_menu): For consistency, use `e' rather than enter to edit the
	command entry.
