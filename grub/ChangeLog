	* shared_src/asm.S (_start): New explicit symbol to supress
	warnings.

	* e2fs_stage1_5/Makefile.am (NO_FANCY_STUFF): Renamed to STAGE1_5,

	stage2_debug/Makefile.am: Likewise.

	* shared_src/disk_inode.h: Fix typo: i_ic shouldn't be defined.

	* shared_src/fsys_ffs.c (block_map): Make static, since this
	function isn't used outside of its defining file.

	* shared_src/disk_io.c [NO_FANCY_STUFF]: Eliminate a whole bunch
	more functions from the stage1.5.  From OKUJI Yoshinori.
	* shared_src/fsys_ffs.c: Likewise.
	* shared_src/char_io.c: Likewise.

1999-03-05  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* shared_src/char_io.c (getkey): Don't set BUF_DRIVE to -1.
	BUF_DRIVE has nothing at all to do with getkey.

	to be more informative.

	LBA mode is detected.

1999-03-02  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* shared_src/disk_io.c (make_saved_active): Use BIOSDISK_READ and
	BIOSDISK_WRITE.

	old binary out of the way before reentering the loop.
	(grub_ASM_ADDR32): Delete conftest files after running the test.

	* debian/rules (binary-arch): Remove empty /sbin directory until
	/sbin/grub is installed.  Use $(DESTDIR) instead of $(prefix) to
	install files.

	* shared_src/asm.S (version_string): Set the version string from
	the VERSION specified in configure.in.

	* Change all Makefiles into Makefile.ams.  Many major build
	environment changes to get Automake/Autoconf working nicely.

1999-02-28  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* NEWS: Moved from docs/NEWS.

	* configure.in, acinclude.m4: New files for Autoconf.  From OKUJI
	Yoshinori.

	* AUTHORS, INSTALL: New files.

1999-02-24  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* stage1/stage1.S (after_BPB): Do a hard disk probe first, so that
	we can work with IDE floppies (like the LS-120).

	* Run GNU Indent on */*.[ch].

1999-02-21  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* debian: Add to the distribution, since we maintain the GRUB
	Debian package ourselves.

	* grub/asmstub.c: New file to implement stubbed assembly functions
	under Unix.

	* stage1/Makefile: Delete spurious dependencies on Makefile.
	* stage2/Makefile: Likewise.
	* stage2_debug/Makefile: Likewise.
	* grub/Makefile: Likewise.

	* shared_src/fsys_ext2fs.c (ext2fs_dir): Follow symbolic links
	rather than giving an error.

	* shared_src/common.c (err_list): Use labeled elements to
	associate messages with error codes.
	* shared_src/shared.h: Make error codes into an enumerated type.

	* shared_src/common.c (err_list): Add ERR_SYMLINK_LOOP.
	* shared_src/shared.h: Likewise.

	* shared_src/char_io.c (bcopy): Don't make any assumptions about
	the length of an unsigned long.

	GNU standards.
	* stage2/Makefile: Likewise.

	* ffs_stage1_5/Makefile: Likewise.

1999-02-20  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* docs/index.html: Rename to grub.html, so that we don't hide
	files in this directory from a web browser.

1999-02-15  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* Makefile.end (PROGS): Add grub.

	* grub/main.c: New file.

	* shared_src/cmdline.c: Use substring.
	* shared_src/fsys_ext2fs.c: Likewise.
	* shared_src/fsys_fat.c: Likewise.
	* shared_src/fsys_ffs.c: Likewise.
	* shared_src/stage2.c: Likewise.

	* shared_src/shared.h: Delete strcmp, declare substring.

	* shared_src/char_io.c (strcmp): Rename to `substring', because
	this function doesn't behave the same as libc's strcmp.

1999-02-14  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* shared_src/shared.h: (addr32, data32): Delete definitions.

	* stage1/stage1.S: Modify to use GAS's new .code16 semantics.
	shared_src/asm.S: Likewise.

	* configure: Test to see if the `addr32' instruction is supported.
	Ian Lance Taylor says that GAS's interpretation of `.code16' has
	changed.  Older versions always generated 32-bit code, but
	implicitly inserted addr32 and data32 when .code16 was given.
	Newer versions generate 16-bit code, and require manual addr32 and
	data32 overrides.

	* shared_src/shared.h: Add some assertions to check that buffer
	addresses are properly defined.

1999-02-12  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	the default and fallback entries.

	directives.

	* shared_src/asm.S: Fix typo that called interrupt 0xd (decimal
	13) instead of 0x13.

	Makefile.
	* fat_stage1_5/Makefile: Likewise.
	* ffs_stage1_5/Makefile: Likewise.

	grubinst.
	(distclean): New GNU standard rule.

1998-10-23  Gordon Matzigkeit  <gord@trick.fig.org>

	* configure: Accept `--host' as a synonym for `--target', and
	accept a non-optional argument as the target name.  Join the
	prefix to the tool name with a hyphen.

	* shared_src/disk_io.c (print_fsys_type): Always print the
	partition type.

	* shared_src/stage2.c (run_menu): Check to make sure that the
	fallback entry is nonnegative.
	(run_menu): For consistency, use `e' rather than enter to edit the
	command entry.
