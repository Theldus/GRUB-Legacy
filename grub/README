This is GNU GRUB, the GRand Unified Bootloader.  GRUB is intended to
provide important bootloader features that are missing from typical
personal computer BIOSes:

  - provides fully-featured command line and graphical interfaces
  - recognizes fdisk partitions and BSD disklabels
  - can dynamically read Linux ext2fs, BSD ufs, and MS-DOS FAT
    filesystems, plus hardcoded blocklists
  - can boot Multiboot-compliant kernels (such as GNU Mach), as well
    as standard Linux and BSD kernels

See the file NEWS for a description of recent changes to GRUB.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install the
GRUB data and program files.  See `docs/install.html' for details
about using GRUB as your bootloader.

If you have any suggestions or bug reports, please send electronic
mail to the GRUB mailing list <bug-grub@gnu.org>.

DEVELOPERS: to subscribe to the mailing list, send e-mail to
<bug-grub-request@gnu.org>.  You can get the latest GRUB CVS tree from
`:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.gnu.org:/gd/gnu/anoncvsroot', module `grub'.
Just hit enter when CVS prompts you for a password.

  IMPORTANT SIZE LIMITS:

  - For the various stage2's, if they are being loaded from a block-list
    in the stage1, then be sure your blocklist is big enough.  The
    automated install will generally do this for you, it's just when
    dropping it on a raw floppy, you get the default compiled in, which
    is 512 * 80 disk sectors, or 40960 bytes.

  - For the FFS stage1.5, if you want to fit into the "bootloader" area
    of an FFS partition, it cannot be larger than 512 * 14 disk sectors,
    or 7168 bytes.
